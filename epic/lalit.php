		<main>
			<p>Lalit Datta: 35 year old game designer working at a very well known game development company. Recently, Lalit was  promoted to project manager on a FPS/RPG set on the surface of Mars. He needs to create a concept for the game, and is looking for information on the geography and weather on Mars in order to make the game as realistic as possible.
			<h4>Use Case</h4>
			 <p>As Lalit searched through Google Images for pictures of Mars' surface, he came across one specific picture that caught his attention. After clicking the image of a sandstorm on Mars, he decided adding extreme weather into the game would improve the player experience and add a new level of immersion and survival to the game. Wanting to learn more about the sand storms, he went to the image source, which led to Deep Dive <em>Curiosity</em> site.</p>
