	<main>
		<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
			<p>The goal of Team Mars is to create an app/website that allows users to view realtime updates, photos, current weather, and information about the <em>Curiosity</em> Rover's mission on Mars. We aim to present this data in a clean, simple format to improve the accessibility of NASA's raw data to the public.</p><br>
		<h2>System Goals</h2>
		<p>The goal of this app will include the following elements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To provide a pleasant user experience to people interested in the <em>Curiosity</em> project.</li>
			<li>To streamline access to project data and eliminate the poor UX provided by the cumbersome NASA website</li>
			<li>To make all of this information accessible in two clicks or less from the main page.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h2>User Stories</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>As a user, I'm interested in the <em>Curiosity</em> project, but I find that NASA's website is cumbersome and hard to navigate.</li>
			<li>I just finished watching the latest episode of <em>Cosmos</em>, and I am interested in learning more about the rover's activity on Mars. Where can I go to find this information in one simple location?</li>
			<li>I am a 6th grade student doing a Science Fair project on the planets of our Solar System and how the weather varies on each. The Nasa website probably has this information, but I can't seem to find it.</li>

		<h2>Persona/Use Case</h2>
		<p>Isaac Chen: 9 years old, currently a third-grader in elementary school. He has been interested in exploring outer space since a very young age. Isaac is not a regular computer user, occasionally consulting the Internet to help with school projects.</p>
		<h4>Use Case</h4>
		<p>After his school announced its upcoming science fair, Isaac began seriously thinking about doing a project about Mars. He did a Google search and found many results; however, the websites he found were too complicated for him to use effectively. He asked his science teacher to help him out. During class, they worked together and finally discovered the "Team Curiosity" website. They found that it was very accessible, and were able to easily get the exact information that Isaac needed for his project, such as photos and climate information from Nasa's databases. The interface of the application was simple and intuitive to both of them, even with Isaac's limited computer experience. They also enjoyed the realtime updates, which kept Isaac coming back to the site even after the science fair was over.</p><br>
		<p>Grayson Jaramillo: 19 years old, currently attending CNM and working at a painting company. In 10th grade, Grayson began watching <em>Cosmos</em> in his free time. After watching the entire series, he found that the episode about planets was specifically interesting to him, and he especially wanted to learn more about Mars.</p>
		<h4>Use Case</h4>
		<p>Throughout the next couple years while he was attending high school, he used the website on his NexGen High School-provided Dell laptop to learn more and more about Mars. Currently, he is planning to attend a high-level university in order to become a major in astrophysics.</p>
