				<li>As a user, I'm interested in the <em>Curiosity</em> project, but I find that NASA's website is cumbersome and hard to navigate.</li>
				<li>I just finished watching the latest episode of <em>Cosmos</em>, and I am interested in learning more about the rover's activity on Mars. Where can I go to find this information in one simple location?</li>
				<li>I am a 6th grade student doing a Science Fair project on the planets of our Solar System and how the weather varies on each. The Nasa website probably has this information, but I can't seem to find it.</li>
