			<p>Isaac Chen: 9 years old, currently a third-grader in elementary school. He has been interested in exploring outer space since a very young age. Isaac is not a regular computer user, occasionally consulting the Internet to help with school projects.</p>
			<h4>Use Case</h4>
			<p>After his school announced its upcoming science fair, Isaac began seriously thinking about doing a project about Mars. He did a Google search on Safari using his Ipad 2 and found many results; however, the websites he found were too complicated for him to use effectively. He asked his science teacher to help him out. During class, they worked together and finally discovered the "Team Curiosity" website. They found that it was very accessible, and were able to easily get the exact information that Isaac needed for his project, such as photos and climate information from Nasa's databases. The interface of the application was simple and intuitive to both of them, even with Isaac's limited computer experience. They also enjoyed the realtime updates, which kept Isaac coming back to the site even after the science fair was over.</p>
