After watching the entire series, he found that the episode about planets was specifically interesting to him, and he especially wanted to learn more about Mars.</p>
			<h4>Use Case</h4>
			<p>Throughout the next couple years while he was attending high school, he used the website on his NexGen High School-provided Dell laptop to learn more and more about Mars. Currently, he is planning to attend a high-level university in order to become a major in astrophysics.</p>
