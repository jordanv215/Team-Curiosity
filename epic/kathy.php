			<p>Kathy Sorenson: 45 years old, works in the office of a local construction company. She has two children in
				middle school. Kathy is normally very busy, but she enjoys walking her dogs and on the weekends she likes to
				watch shows on Netflix. At home, she uses a 15" HP laptop to access the internet using Chrome. Kathy also
				has an LG smartphone, which is her primary device for personal use at the office and whenever she's on the
				go.</p>
			<h4>Use Case</h4>
			<p>This morning, Kathy was scrolling down her Facebook news feed on her phone when she came across a headline
				from a local TV station about the recent confirmation of flowing water on the surface of Mars. She clicked
				on the item and watched the short video which accompanied it, which also mentioned the NASA rover that is
				currently exploring Mars. Kathy's interest was piqued and she did a Google search to find more information.
				As she was using a small screen and only had five minutes, she was looking for a page that would provide
				exactly what she was looking for without having to click through multiple screens, and she needed a site
				that would offer an excellent user experience on par with a native app. She clicked on a link which
				advertised a live feed of images from the <em>Curiosity</em> rover. Kathy found that the site was extremely
				simple, having two main navigation options at the top of the main page. She clicked on the image gallery,
				and enjoyed scrolling smoothly through the feed of photos, which loaded without any perceptible delay. Kathy enjoyed the site so much that she bookmarked it to view the pictures on her larger screen when she got home</p>
