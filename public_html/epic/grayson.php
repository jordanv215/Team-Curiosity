			<p>Grayson Jaramillo: 19 years old, currently attending CNM and working at a painting company. His level of familiarity with information technology is typical of a casual user in the current 18-to-35 age range. He has an an HP desktop with a 19-inch screen, running Windows 10. He prefers to use Firefox. His primary mobile device is a Samsung Galaxy S6 running Android 6.0 with Chrome. In 10th grade, Grayson began watching <em>Cosmos</em> in his free time. Currently, he is planning to attend a high-level university in order to become a major in astrophysics.</p>
			<h4>Use Case</h4>
			<p>After watching the entire <em>Cosmos</em> series, Grayson found that the episode about planets was specifically interesting to him. He was fascinated by the ongoing exploration of Mars, and went online on his phone to find information about the current activities of the NASA-built rover traveling the surface at this moment. He performed a Google search for "Curiosity rover updates" and was presented with a list of results. Grayson clicked on a link which stood out because of its specific nature and the fact that it offered weather updates as well. The site loaded an interface which looked exactly like a typical mobile app, and was exceptionally easy to navigate. Grayson browsed through the science article feed for awhile and then signed up to receive RSS updates.</p>
