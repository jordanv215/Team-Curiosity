				Curiosity is a car-sized, six-wheeled robot destined for Gale Crater on Mars.
				Its mission: to see if Mars ever could have supported small life forms called microbes...and if humans could survive there someday! In addition to super-human senses that help us understand Mars as a habitat for life, Curiosity's parts are similar to what a human would need to explore Mars (body, brains, eyes, arm, legs, etc.). Check it out though--sometimes they are located in odd places!
